/// The code generator a project's `[factory] backend` selects.
///
/// luaux 0.2.0 replaced the single Vide backend with two *arrangements* — which
/// is the only thing a backend now decides — and the choice is the project's,
/// not ours:
///
/// * [`Table`] — `F(class)(props)`, children in the props table. Vide, Fusion,
///   Fluid.
/// * [`Element`] — `F(class, props, children)`, children positional. React.
///
/// Every compile in this server goes through here, because compiling with the
/// wrong arrangement is not a near miss: the generated call has a different
/// shape, so the source map's anchors miss, and every forwarded position in the
/// file is then either absent or — worse — pointing somewhere the author did
/// not write.
