//! Building a [`SourceMap`] from a `.luaux` source and the `.luau` the compiler
//! produced from it.
//!
//! The compiler does not hand out a map, so this recovers one. Two properties
//! make that possible without guessing:
//!
//! 1. **Lines are preserved**, so region *N* of the source occupies the same
//!    output lines, which pins every region's output range without searching.
//! 2. **Expressions are captured verbatim**, so each one appears byte for byte in
//!    the output, immediately after generated text whose exact shape is known —
//!    `Size = `, `Text = `, `__luaux_read(`.
//!
//! Everything located here is then checked by [`SourceMap::push`], which refuses
//! any run whose two sides do not actually agree. So a shape this builder does
//! not recognise costs *coverage* — that position simply stops being forwarded —
//! and can never produce a position pointing at the wrong code (decision 6).
